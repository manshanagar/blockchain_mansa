# DAO Voting Platform

## Project Description
The DAO Voting Platform allows users to create and vote on proposals within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Users can vote for or against proposals, with votes tracked on the blockchain.

## Vision
To create a transparent and decentralized platform where users can actively participate in decision-making within a DAO by voting on proposals.

## Key Features
- **Proposal Creation**: Users can create new proposals with a description.
- **Voting**: Users can cast votes on proposals, with options for "yes" or "no."
- **On-Chain Transparency**: All proposals and voting data are stored on the blockchain.

## Future Scope
- **Weighted Voting**: Introduce token-weighted voting, where votes carry weight based on the user's token holdings.
- **Proposal Expiration**: Set time limits for voting on proposals.
- **Voting Incentives**: Implement reward mechanisms for users who participate in voting.
